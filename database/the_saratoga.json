            "text": "I went to Saratoga with friends for a lazy sunday brunch. Unfortunately, we had a booking for 2 people but another friend decided to join us too hence we were seated at the bar ( as they had no bigger tables available,either tables of two or big parties ) I would suggest you make your reservations in advance. \n It was a blessing in disguise as we got seats at the bar really,because the bartender was amazing and he made the best drinks, you should definitely try \"Grandma's Hot Cocoa\"- its a hot chocolate rendition to irish coffee. The other drink we had was \"Root\"- again a great gin based cocktail. \n Food and service was excellent too, the only thing that i think will bring my experience points down is that we ordered for billionaire's bacon but the server/ bartender forgot to order it, so when the rest of food arrived, the bacon took an additional 20 mins. Not the end of the world, the bacon was perfect!!!! \n Definitely recommend the place.",

Our server seemed to lose interest in us when he realized we were there for a light meal. There were four of us and between us we ordered two mains, two salads, fries, a vegetable, and an appetizer plus 4 cocktails and one glass of wine. Our appetizer came quickly and was finished long before we received our drinks. When a second round of drinks was ordered it took forever to get them along with the rest of our food. I would like to go back because the food was exceptionally good but our server was very sulky and slow. I can't imagine why because we were courteous and he would have been fully able to turn the table for an 8 o'clock seating.",
